I wondered whether this was because this is just how the company is set up, this is how the people in charge think, or they might just not understand how to use their data better."

I like how you connected it to the DELTA model, especially the part about “targets.”\nI think to answer your question, one way to make sure our metrics support the right behaviors is to always ask why we're tracking something. There has to be a goal or decision of why we care about what we are tracking. I think also including the people who will be using the data is important,t as they will see if the information is relevant or not."

How do biases prevent us from accepting facts? It seems as if medical professionals, even after being proven wrong, were steadfast in their belief they knew better. Was this because the person proving them wrong was a child and lacked the medical training they had received?\nIn my daily work I am often left verifying data because I do not know the source well. I must first establish trust. How can we best accept facts and data when they are not presented by known sources or those who we feel are not qualified to offer such information? How do you go about establishing a source as dependable and accurate?"

They are often put in place without following any kind of standard and with little documentation in the hopes they will only be there a short while. Years go by and when something breaks and no one has any idea about the shortcut or how it worked. I deal with this regularly with my company's warehousing system. \nDo you find that your are dealing with multiple versions of reports (everyone saved a copy and personalized it)? I have had this experience as well and it has caused sever failures or made people out to be rock stars when in fact they were failing to do the job. Everyone was using the same report with a different output. The \"single source of truth\" had been lost due to poor security controls on the ability to edit reports."

I spent some time this last summer learning about Google Analytics and how there are many free tools available and so I think there are economical ways for small business to gather and analyze information. I think the hardest part is knowing what data you need to be looking at, what is available for analysis, and what to do once you have the data. Much like we have learned throughout this first week, we need to clearly define what it is we really need to know and why. This can keep a small business from investing in fancy programs that really provide too much for what needs to be accomplished."

I am a business owner who uses some data analytics but am not passing that information on to my team as well as I should. I have, unintentionally, been hoarding it just because I wasn't sure if it could be helpful to them. I've realized I am doing too much of the analysis on my own without including them in both the gathering and use of the data.

This stood out because my husband and I own a dental practice. I am currently working with a company to analyze the payout rates of the different insurance companies we are contracted with and then renegotiate our contracts. While we knew insurance reimbursement rates were low, it wasn't until I recently started doing a deeper analysis that I realized exactly how low they are for some companies. We realized we were losing money in some cases. This prompted us to work towards renegotiating with the companies for better reimbursement rates. Doing this analysis and others will help me gain better insight into our business and areas we can improve."

I've only done basic analysis so far and am very excited to use Power BI to get a better understanding of insurance reimbursement. How does insurance apply to your field? Do you struggle to get companies to pay, and how do the reimbursement rates compare? Working with insurance is the most frustrating part of our job.  You mentioned you are trying to support small business owners to prevent burnout. Do you see similar struggles in PT?\nThe average reimbursement from insurance for dental is 50 - 60%. If we are contracted with the company, we write off the balance. It's a massive cut to profits. I just attended a conference where they discussed how to increase your PPO reimbursement rate through negotiation. However, the interesting thing they've found is that most dental offices don't get significantly better rates when you negotiate directly with the insurance company. Negotiation companies that have personal relationships with individuals at the insurance company can get almost full-fee reimbursement. After looking at the data, we see that it's the most effective thing we can do to improve profits. The fee we will pay them to negotiate for us should have a huge ROI."

I found an article from Harvard Business Review titled Why Companies That Wait to Adopt AI May Never Catch Up, which talks about how companies often struggle to scale analytics and AI because their data has become fragmented or poorly managed. This directly supports the book’s point that without clean, consistent, and accessible data, no amount of technology or tools will drive effective results. The article also emphasized the importance the for a strong “data fabric” before companies can fully take advantage of AI. Analytical success doesn't start with tools or talent rather it starts with trusted, integrated data.

My current job is quite unique in comparison to others but I play college football right now. As a quarterback I rely on film breakdowns of defensive coverages, pressures, and front structures to prepare for an opponent. To go through every play a team has played is unrealistic, so I rely on data inputs and summaries of those data inputs to find trends and consistencies in a defensive call. A lack of accuracy and reliability would be detrimental to my job because I can spend countless hours preparing for something to see that may not actually be there due to bad data."

One thing that companies tend to overlook are the unofficial authority figures. The outspoken individuals within an organization that can influence those people around them. So, in your situation, I think small businesses can begin this data-driven culture with an internal champion. Find someone who is knowledgeable, driven and wants to see things get better.

        "content": "One thing that I found interesting in our readings this week was the importance of quality data, specifically ensuring that decisions aren’t made on false data. My company sends out quarterly surveys to identify many “intangibles” like culture, belonging, work/life balance and trust among colleagues. It is helpful to voice concerns, but sometimes there is ambiguity with the questioning. For example, trust among colleagues. A question would be, “on a scale of 1-5, how much do you trust your colleagues?” It’s difficult to answer, because they don’t specify whether they are referring to teammates, cross-functional partners or headquarters. The answer could be different for each one. Since the questions lack specificity, they are actually receiving inaccurate data, which in turn would make any solutions not necessarily helpful. I like the saying, “garbage in, garbage out.” Taking the time to accurately gather good information will help give good outputs."

        "content": "Coming from the digital marketing industry, there were so many key points that stood out to me in these chapters; things I've experienced, things I want to apply, and so on.  I've whittled down my whiteboard of thoughts and questions into the following two. \n1. Digital marketing is split between two major groups called Branding and Performance Generation. Branding often falls into the trap that the efforts are immeasurable, and therefore turns to more subjective modes for decision making (huge opportunity to measure the immeasurable and improve decision making and performance). Performance Generation is usually very data-focused, but in recent years, the quality of the data has decreased with privacy policies (like iOS 14.5). From my perspective, I don't think users should have privacy based on the social engagement (watching content, clicking links, visiting websites), but the number of people that opt in to sharing privacy data with iOS is staggeringly low (I also don't opt in to share my data). What's the difference between physical engagement (walking into a store and having a rep try to sell to you) and digital engagement (visiting a website and being hit with retargeting ads)? This is one small part of social media privacy policies, but I'm curious, what do people not in marketing think the line should be for data collection of users?\n2. My second key point that I wanted to highlight in this comment is about the role employees can play to progress or advance the stage in the model of progress. At my current role and company, we are the definition of stage 2 (localized) for data. When I started a few months ago, I pushed for the marketing team to create its own data stores since we didn't have anything available company-wide. Since then, I've found that both HR and finance are using their own approaches to data. When addressing the need to senior leadership to create a company wide data structure I'm met with resistance on a few fronts: it would be too expensive, each groups needs their own data so it is relevant to them, management doesn't want to deal with it - if divisions do that is there responsibility/problem. How can I help advance the stage/desire for company-wide data and the expectation to use data in decision-making in a company that initially doesn't care for it?"

This fits into lean methodologies, which I love and embrace! You don't want to move along a product (of data in this case) with errors, as it will compound the problem. Addressing the data collection first will allow the adjustments made at the other points of the data analysis process to be more impactful. Good luck with the project of improving the data!"

They understand in order to analysis the data efficiently, the data must be reliable and true. When spending the time at the beginning with good resources and trustworthy information, decisions can be made that not only benefit the transaction taking place but the long-term success of the company.\nMy question is, how do you know your data is trustworthy? What sources should be used to know the information you are using is correct and will provide the most benefit when making decisions?"

That distinction helped me think differently about how data can actually influence decisions—if it's part of a consistent, organization-wide effort. Chapter 2 added another layer by stressing that not all data is equal, and that understanding what data matters is just as important as having it. At my workplace, we gather a ton of data, but I’ve noticed we often lack clarity on which metrics actually drive value. That leads to wasted effort or decisions based more on gut feeling than evidence. It made me wonder—how do successful companies figure out which data is most relevant to their goals, especially when there’s so much available?"

Your HVAC example really drives that home. I’ve seen similar situations where the tools were in place, but without someone pushing for their use, nothing changed.\nTo your question: I think one way to bring skeptical leaders on board is by starting small—showing quick wins through pilot projects or simple dashboards that solve a pain point they care about. When they see real, tangible results tied to data (like your fuel cost reduction), it builds credibility. Pairing that with storytelling—connecting data to outcomes and people—can make analytics feel less abstract and more actionable."

        "content": "Hi Jamie, thanks for sharing! I really resonante with your point about “garbage in, garbage out” really resonates. At my company, we faced similar data integrity issues, especially as we scaled and brought in new systems. Initially, leadership underestimated how much bad data was costing us in terms of rework, reporting errors, and poor decision-making. It wasn’t until we quantified the downstream impact—missed forecasts, inventory write-offs, and even customer churn—that the case for data governance gained traction.\nWe adopted a “quality at the source” approach by integrating validation rules directly into our ERP and CRM systems. For example, we implemented drop-down menus instead of free text fields, automated required field checks, and added logic to flag anomalies in real-time. What really helped get leadership buy-in was showing how upstream data accuracy reduced firefighting and saved analyst time downstream—turning it from a cost center into an efficiency enabler. Bad data can be frustrating and costly to deal with, but taking the time to clean the data can be a real game changer!"

        "content": "One of the points in Chapter 1 that was interesting for me was the point that “analytical decisions require scrutiny”. Even when there is data or models suggesting something, it’s still worthwhile to view them with some level of skepticism. This is something that I’ve experience in my own work – instead of taking the outcome of the analysis and running, it’s important to ensure that the assumptions and key drivers of the data have also been analyzed by the right people. If the person who is building and maintaining the model is the only one creating and assessing the driving assumptions, the data can be misleading at times.\nThis happened at my company when a member of my team helped update our financial model to look at 12/24/36 month growth curve. When I got into the data, I noticed that many of the drivers were based on historical data sets that weren’t exactly reflective of our current trajectory. One of the key issues was that in a prior year, we had a large customer that helped generate new revenue streams and the projections were including continued growth with them instead of taking their revenue baseline to $0. There were also 2 peaks in prior years where we had run promotions that we wouldn’t be continuing in the future. Once those were identified, we were able to normalize those points and rerun the model."

        "content": "Critical thoughts\nOne of the concepts that called out to me the most was for a \"single source of truth\". Half of what I do is just trying to find the correct information from the right people. A good way to illustrate this is that for the last couple of months I have been writing a program that is able to schedule hundreds to thousands of unique composite aircraft parts in a matter of 10 to 20 minutes. The program is right around 1000 lines of code, but only about 70 lines are for the logic of scheduling. The other 900+ lines of code is just pulling in tables from SQL databases, json files from URL addresses, and excel spreadsheets and then joining dataframes, converting files, and filtering obsolete columns. Truly a mess, but it is something that has not been done in the 12+ years of this particular program's existence because of how difficult it is to get trustworthy data, and know the right person to even know where to look for the data. \n \nPart of the reason for this I believe is because the program has been around for a couple of company mergers and buyouts. In the length of the program it has changed hands 3 or 4 times. Each time the company tries to align the systems at work with their enterprise standard. The integration is never seamless so bandaid solutions are used. My favorite quote “There's nothing so permanent as a temporary solution”. But, those bandaid solutions are integrated into the next companies enterprise standard and then more bandaids are introduced to the next integration. It gets out of control fast, and when people eventually leave the company the tribal knowledge of what is an intentional process and what is a necessary work around is lost or the lines are blurred. I can only imagine being able to go to a single source of truth for data, but then again that is part of the reason that keeps my position a necessary job."

        "content": "My answer to your question would be research. I did an internship in a cancer research lab. As I was working and reading research papers published by other labs, it was crazy to see the results that researchers would draw from their results. We would look at those same numbers and wonder how they got from the data to their conclusion. Sometimes it's just a researcher trying to prove his or her  hypothesis correct. Other times it can be because of funding. Researchers are paid based on grants that they receive from companies or the government or some other organization. And sometimes that funding comes with an expectation (like proving that their product really works). If the data shows that the product only works 25% of the time, researchers can still be inclined to claim that it works so they can continue getting paid."

They spend a lot of time and money looking at reports to make business decisions, where before the owner made decisions based on his opinion of how to run the business.\nI found this link talking about the necessity of using analytics specifically in the veterinary field. \nhttps://veterinaryha.org/leveraging-data-analytics-for-business-growth-in-veterinary-practices/#:~:text=Data%20analytics%20is%20a%20game,satisfaction%2C%20and%20ultimately%20boost%20profitability\n    \n\nLinks to an external site..\nI have never thought that analytics would be so applicable in any sort of healthcare field. For the most part, I've always thought that people went to the doctor when they needed it and advertising or changing things about your practice would have little effect. Now, based on my own experience and on the material from this week, I see that analytics can have an impact in any sort of field."

There are obviously other tools and concepts that would be important to ensure that data is well managed as an organization grows, but I think starting with the right culture and attitude is important."

I work as a supply chain analyst for a large ecommerce retailer in a competitive and volatile segment of the outdoor industry. My organization takes the concept of \"owning\" all useful data very seriously and I have seen its many benefits on numerous occassions. The organization has an office based in Ukraine whose only goal is to optimize data management from the enterprise perspective. We have our own propreitary ERP software and own all of the information systems that we use. I have seen the benefits of this on supply chain performance because having complete control over this data makes obtaining new information incredibly fast. I have seen this flexibility and agility put to good use by management to make extremely difficult supply chain decisions and bring in revenue that likely could not have been obtained otherwise."

In my experience, I have seen most companies perform in the “localized analytics” category. I believe this this the worst situation, because a company can believe they are expending massive efforts to be “analytical” and think they are succeeding, but because of silos the analysis returns very few results and does not empower decision making.\nI have seen many companies struggle to coordinate data analytics to achieve a unified purpose, and goals to further the company in success. I’ve been thinking about this since starting the reading and I thought I’d shoot the question out to the group. What are some ways you have seen companies progress pass localized analytics to achieve coordinated efforts, goals, and progress based on data that benefits the organization as a whole?"

I work in the thermal engineering field, and waiting for temperatures to stabilize makes gathering data a long process. I agree that careful planning of data collection is as or more important than the postprocessing of data.\nOne struggle is when there is uncertainty in what data will be valuable and aid in decision making. Often in this scenario, too much data is gathered, generally in the breadth of data gathered and in the process it is determined what is actually needed. However this requires additional testing to gather a depth of data in the field newly \"discovered\". Because of this I feel data collection efforts, specifically in engineering testing, are often given too little schedule to allow for adequate testing. \nThat being said, we always need to know what is \"good enough\" and when to stop."

In the Shingo MBA program and more broadly the Lean/Six Sigma world we talk a lot about Key Behavioral Indicators, which are the precursors to Key Performance Indicators.\nSo what observable (quantifiable) behaviors have a causal relationship with performance? If it's not immediately clear, we have to do a lot of observing, counting and then running statistical tests to figure it out. Once we do, we train on and attempt to integrate and standardize those behaviors into the work process with a mind toward making it easier to do the right behavior than the wrong one, along with a reliable way consistently measure those behaviors. As we know from HtMA, everything is tangible, and if a behavior strongly affects KPIs, the economic value of going to the trouble of measuring them should be worth it."

Often when we do this we pull inaccurate data and it can lead to calling a random business, having misleading financial information, and lack of clarity on our end.\n \nTo fix this we have implemented software that sorts the data for us, finds duplicates, and flags inaccurate information.

I also come from an Economics background and I am currently in a Supply Chain Management role. I think when I was studying marketing strategies it seemed like the perfect way to understand customer behavior, targeting ads based on social engagement. As a consumer, I don't mind being targeted based on engagement, since usually they are products that are of interest to me based on previous engagement. Obviously, users want to know what data is being collected and why, so they prefer to opt-in rather than be automatically tracked. So, obviously data should be protected so its not misused, but also I think it's better for the company and users that only necessary data should be collected, nothing excessive, irrelevant, or too personal, which might provide better data quality. I think this is where I would draw the line. As a non marketing person I think purpose driven data collection is key in supply chain management as well in order to collect only what’s necessary to maintain readiness and efficiency, but also incorporating data governance and access control to protect sensitive information, especially when dealing with international partners. So, just like in marketing, there's a growing need in defense logistics to balance quality and useful data, as well as privacy, especially as systems become more automated with AI, and just like users want to opt-in, partners also want to know and trust that data is being used for the right purpose and ethically."

Data analytics is essential for my day-to-day tasks, and if the data isn’t solid and doesn’t check all those boxes, it just looks like a bunch of numbers on a spreadsheet that don’t mean much. The two things that stood out to me the most, especially since I’ve been trying to improve how we capture data, are making sure the data is high-quality and well-structured. That’s key when it comes to planning and running global operations. For example, if we have bad or outdated inventory data for aircraft parts, it can slow down maintenance, ground aircraft, and disrupt missions. And when different bases or countries use inconsistent data formats, it can delay coordination and slow everything down. But when the data is clean and consistent, it helps us make better decisions, improve logistics, and keep everything running smoothly."

The more we are able to automate the processes and eliminate the human factor I believe can help us to remove this bad data and it's chances for error. But often times this can be the big problem of how to do that without implementing such expensive systems. In my line of work, we can't afford these errors and because I work in aerospace they are willing to invest in ways to remove these errors. If we need a machine that can accurately scan or measure the dimensions on specific tooling that has to have specific fit tolerances, we need to make sure those dimensions and what we measure them are within many degrees of accuracy."

I agree with your take on how data driven investors tend to outperform those who rely on gut feelings or hype. Only select few people usually are able to cash out on these type of trades and typically it is the data driven trades that succeed in the long run.  I’d even extend your point by highlighting how behavioral finance studies have shown that emotions like fear and greed often lead to irrational decisions, especially during crazy markets. This emotional \nYour example of Renaissance Technologies is especially compelling. It reminds me of how even in businesses outside of finance, using analytics helps strip away personal bias and leads to more informed decision making."

        "content": "A topic that stuck out to me in the readings was in chapter 2 focusing on uniqueness.\nIt emphasize that unique data sets not easily replicated by competitors are a way that can give organizations a edge over the competition in analytics. While anyone can access generic industry data or buy third-party information, the value lies in internal data of a company that is deeply tied to a company’s specific processes, customer interactions, or operations.\nFor example, a retailer like Amazon has uniquely detailed customer behavior data from its platform such as what people search for, how long they browse, and what they abandon in their carts. This kind of data is not available to competitors and allows Amazon to personalize recommendations and optimize inventory in ways others can’t do. I think a unique dataset is a great way to set your company apart if used correctly. However, on the flip side I do think to unique of a data set may result skewed or non helpful information."

        "content": "An interesting and cool concept in Chapter 1 that really caught my attention was  the introduction of the DELTA model . The DETLA model outlines the six key elements organizations need to compete analytically. DELTA stands for Data, Enterprise, Leadership, Targets, Analysts. What’s particularly interesting about this model is how it shifts the focus from just having data or tools to building a full system that enables and supports data driven decision making.\nI found it especially interesting that it highlights Leadership as one of the core elements. Many people assume analytics success comes from hiring some with technical expertise or buying some new fancy software, but Chapter 1 emphasizes that without executive support and Leadership, organizations won’t see results. Leaders drive the cultural change and investment needed for analytics to thrive.\nAdditionally, the idea that analytics can be used not only to explain the past but also to predict trends and the future is something I have always like about data analysis. It shows how analytics is about action and not just insight. This sets the tone for analytics truly can be used in real world scenarios."

What is important though is how we manipulate that data and whether that data can actually show us something or not. The key really is to focus in on the data points that you think will help you find out or prove the point you are looking for. Sometimes it even seems like there is more useless data then useful. I agree with your point on rabbit holes and that we can get lost going down the wrong path as well when looking into data."

I’ve seen the same confusion in my organization. Different teams trust different systems, and without clear data ownership or governance, it’s easy to fall into the trap of building reports that don’t align.\nWhat stood out to me in the reading was how important it is to measure the right things. Without structure and accountability around the data, people will shape it to tell whatever story they want. We’ve started creating clearer SOPs and assigning ownership for key data fields, but it’s still early. Reading this made me realize that data governance isn’t just a tech issue. It’s a leadership issue."

Davenport makes it clear: it’s not enough to have the data if no one’s using it to guide behavior. I’ve seen this firsthand. We’ve built some great reporting tools in IT, but without clear direction or consistent follow-through, the insights just sit there. It becomes another system people check occasionally, but it doesn’t drive decisions.\n \nThat’s why I keep coming back to the question: Are we measuring the right things? If the data doesn’t tie back to the behavior we’re trying to encourage, we risk tracking what’s easy instead of what’s useful. Chapter 2’s DELTA model touches on this—especially the “T” for targets. It reminded me how easy it is to get busy measuring everything, and forget that the real goal is clarity, not complexity.\n \nSo here’s my question: How do we make sure the metrics we choose actually reinforce the outcomes and behaviors we want—rather than distract from them?"

Progress usually starts with something imperfect but useful."

I think one way to bring skeptical leaders on board is to start small by using analysis to solve a specific, visible problem and clearly show the results.

I’d support the idea that a thoughtful estimate, even with minimal data, can be more valuable than either a pure guess or an overly detailed calculation. In real-world situations, such as business decisions, emergency planning, or strategic thinking, there might not be enough time to gather perfect data. Becoming too focused on perfect accuracy can hinder progress and the pursuit of precise numbers might delay decisions that could have been made effectively with a reasonable approximation. Fermi estimation encourages flexible thinking and highlights the power of breaking down complex problems into manageable parts.  \nI appreciated the article because it highlights how Fermi estimation encourages active engagement with fundamental concepts, fostering critical thinking and logical reasoning. This method promotes deeper understanding by requiring individuals to break down complex problems into core components and assess how each part contributes to the overall picture, rather than relying solely on precise data. \nhttps://academic.oup.com/plphys/advance-article/doi/10.1093/plphys/kiae347/7693667\n    \n\nLinks to an external site."

This framework Data, Enterprise, Leadership, Targets, Analysts, emphasizes that success in analytics is not just about having the best tools or the most data but about aligning organizational culture and leadership with a strategic vision for data use.\nSupporting Opinion:I support the authors’ assertion that Leadership is the most critical element of the DELTA model. Without executive-level champions, analytics initiatives often remain siloed, underfunded, or misunderstood. This is evident in many companies I’ve seen where strong data science teams exist, but leadership does not understand or use their output, which leads to wasted potential. According to a 2022 Harvard Business Review article titled Why So Many Data Science Projects Fail\n    \n\nLinks to an external site., up to 85% of analytics projects never deliver the expected business value—often because they lack executive sponsorship and strategic alignment.\nReal-World Application:At the Space Dynamics Laboratory, where I work as a Software Test Engineer.  Applying the DELTA model could improve our use of test data for performance prediction and system optimization. In particular, clearer Targets, business questions driving analysis, would help ensure that efforts are aligned with leadership needs, such as system readiness or cost forecasting.\nQuestion:How can organizations ensure that mid-level managers, who often serve as the bridge between executives and data teams, are equipped to understand and advocate for analytics efforts? While DELTA emphasizes executive leadership, many analytics initiatives stall at the middle-management level due to lack of data literacy or resistance to change. What are practical strategies to engage this critical layer of the organization?"

At a previous job in a call center, I witnessed this often. The data and preliminary analysis our team provided to supervisors were frequently reshaped to align with what the COO and floor managers wanted to hear. I believe this type of misuse led to a lack of trust in the data among those who were more familiar with reality, and that it likely played a role in the company’s eventual downfall.\nThe reading also seemed to focus heavily on the capabilities of larger organizations.

I have to say that I completely agree, and I would actually add one thing, and that is that the uniqueness of data does not have to necessarily be the fact that the data itself is unique, but you could also make the data unique through the process of data refinement. For example, the Air Force has a lot of data on how many parts are down, and which planes are grounded up to this point, and everyone has access to that information, but what my company does is we work to actually forecast when there will be shortage of parts for specific plane models, and start to meet the manufacturing needs before they even arrive. So, I feel that it does not have to necessarily be the source of data that is unique, but I feel that the data can also be unique just because of how you are using the data.

I really struggle with this task for the same reasons you mentioned. One of our questions, and one my team ranked lower this past quarter, is to respond on a scale from 1 to 6 regarding the employee's agreement with the following statement, \"I am recognized for my contributions to the organization.\" Recognition could mean different things to different individuals, including their compensation. While these types of surveys can have issues with data quality, they can still bring issues and opportunities to the surface. I have even reviewed results with my team members to ask for their thoughts on what we can do better and end up hearing some of the actual meaning of the responses.

After learning about each stage I found that at the enterprise level, the company is between stage 4 and stage 5. We have specific elements in place, such as a data warehouse, governance, strict privacy controls. We have a business intelligence competency center, which we call Enterprise Business Intelligence, and several business decisions are made using analytics of our customer segmentation and opportunities to grow our small business relationships.\nWhat I do feel keeps us from being a stage 5 company is that I don’t feel that our analytics has reached an enterprise-wide approach. For example, in my area of banking operations, we leverage some customer and account data from our data warehouse, but we have our own data, be it transactional or non-numerical data, that is not integrated with the data warehouse. So, within my division, I feel like we are operating at stage 2 or stage 3. We have created our own localized pocket of data analytics to serve our needs and purposes and have a vision of where we would like our analytics to be, though, as the readings suggest, this has been a slow effort.\nI wanted to ask a question to gather your thoughts on if this relationship between the enterprise being at stage 4 and my division at stage 2 is healthy? Is there some level of acceptance that this could occur until my division’s data is structured and ready to be integrated into the data warehouse? Do you think there is localized data that may not belong in the data warehouse which would necessitate the need for localized analytics?"

In the Data chapter of Analytics at Work, the authors introduced an idea they named the \"10 percent solution.\" This solution describes a shortcut for running analysis by using only 10 percent of the available data. While this is described as an \"early step\" for most companies, I believe it could also operate as a successful heuristic for common decisions.\nFor example, a few years ago I had money that I wanted to invest. I spent about a year talking to dozens of people about how they invested their money. I read articles and watched videos on YouTube. At the end of the day, my delay in making a decision almost certainly cost me money I could have earned by investing earlier. If I had applied the 10 percent solution, I would have felt like I had enough information to make a decision in about a month instead of a year."

By analyzing variance data on a manufacturing process, we discovered that one of our steps was creating a disproportionate number of problems. By focusing efforts on improving that step, we were able to reduce errors significantly and save about $77k annually. I would've been over the moon to save $880k! That's phenomenal. And I completely agree - it's almost impossible to fix a problem until you know what the problem is. Careful analysis of the data is a great way to discover what the problems are."

I feel like we have a whole team dedicated to making them!  I would agree entering stuff right the first time is always the best approach but not always achievable I think the best way to support your answer besides investing more into data governance is to invest more into the employees. If you have a really talented employee I would rather pay more to keep them around and happy then rotate through multiple not as talented or careful employees. I have seen both sides of this coin in my career where company a cares more and has a super talented team and works well as a unit and I have seen companies where people are constantly let go or are quitting because it just is not worth it and they are always behind due to errors and mistakes."

Being on the accounting team I feel like we are one of maybe three departments that use our data effectively. I feel like our marketing is niche and outdated and as a company as a whole we do not track much internal let alone external data when it comes to things that could give us an edge. We are one of the top competitors in our field and I am just wondering if the amount of hiring friends and family in the company is impacting growth and the flow of good ideas and communication because it feels like people know they cannot get fired and act like it. I wonder how much human emotion,relationships and honesty affect data and how well companies use it. The logic behind this is that I know for a fact we all have lied on surveys, or in the workplace or covered up a mistake or two in our careers but I wonder how these little seemingly harmless choices can mislead the company as a whole."

Offer an alternative or supporting opinion, supported by reason and/or evidence, on something that you found interesting in the readings.\nChapter 2: Data Quality\nA concept that stood out to me in this chapter was that analytics doesn't require perfect data. The \"good enough\" concept seemed a bit ironic when businesses have to make decisions with accurate information. How can an analysis be completed with incomplete data? Qualified analysts can make decisions with the missing data because they fill in the blanks. Perfection will slow down the process, Analysts just require the right data in the right places. \nSupport:\nAt first this concept was difficult to understand because data usually requires accuracy. However, most businesses would never make decisions if they waited for perfect data. The real world does not operate in a space of perfection. For example, customers information might be outdated in the system but that doesn't interfere with the consumer patterns. The company can predict future purchases without knowing if the address on file is accurate.\nQuestion:Is it conflicting that data is expected to be accurate, yet in some cases, missing information is considered good enough? How can data, decision-making, and imperfection coexist while still striving for efficiency?\""

In sports, for instance, it’s possible to hide behind the numbers. A player might excel in one area, and as a result, their metrics may appear favorable—showing \"green\" in our system. However, if you actually watched the game, you might notice that the player had little to no impact. They were just a body on the court.

The organization collects a lot of data on athlete participation, volunteer hours, and program outcomes, but without a clear plan to use it, data can become overwhelming. This can lead to analysis paralysis, where too much information prevents effective decision-making. This shows that while data is valuable, having a clear strategy for using it is just as important.\nApplying the DELTA model at Special Olympics could mean using athlete data to identify areas for training improvement or to track program impact. For example, analyzing performance data could reveal which sports or programs need more resources or where additional support could have the most impact. This targeted approach could help allocate resources more effectively and support athlete development.\nA practical example of Special Olympics using data analytics is their partnership with SC&H Group for the 2020 Corporate Polar Plunge event. By utilizing Tableau for live analytics, they showcased their top donors and organizations, leading to over $490,000  and passing their $400,000 goal. This data-driven approach allowed Special Olympics Maryland to sponsor more than 1,900 athletes in events or experiences in 2020.\nOne question that came to mind while reading: How can Special Olympics encourage staff and volunteers to not just understand data but actually use it in everyday decisions? What kinds of training or resources could make data more accessible and actionable within the organization?"

When organizations collect data, they need to evaluate the credibility and accuracy of their sources. This could mean working with reputable vendors, using standard data collection processes, and using quality control checks to identify errors. One method could be cross-referencing it against other trusted data points to verify its accuracy. When organizations commit to thorough data verification and governance, they set themselves up to make decisions that benefit their goals and long term success!"

If you can calculate the ROI of improved data quality by looking at saved time, increased conversions, or avoided errors, the decision becomes much easier.

One of my favorite faulty statistical insights is that the more ice cream people consume as whole, the more often people drown. This statement implies a causal effect between eating ice cream and drowning, however it is wrong because it is referring to a correlation but calling it causation. It is more accurate to assume that a hot and sunny day causes higher ice cream consumption (eating it to stay cool) and drowning (because people are swimming more often). \nIn my HR analytics class, I had the opportunity to create a case study. The data for this case study hid several important relationships that the rest of my class had to uncover as they sifted through it. It was very important that we didn't make any assumptions once we say numbers align, but our task was to ask ourselves what comes next and what can we do address these problems. Jumping to conclusions can be a gross oversight when deal with data--the real value being found in how the data is being interpreted, or in other words, what is being illuminated. \nHas there been a time in your life (perhaps professionally) when you thought the data was saying one thing but turned out to say something different?"

In the funeral and cemetery profession, our teams used to rely heavily on anecdotal feedback or delayed reporting. It led to frustration and slow response times. This year, we introduced a new customer survey process that follows a more structured approach, including closed loop feedback and detailed analytics that track the customer journey from start to finish. While we did not formally call it the DELTA model, many of its elements—especially leadership support and clear targets—were critical to getting the initiative off the ground and making it effective.\nYour point about engineers having their own data methods really resonated with me. Without a shared framework, it is easy for different teams to operate in silos, which limits the impact of the data.

What stood out to me was the emphasis on \"Leadership\" as a necessary condition. Analytics initiatives rarely succeed without leaders who actively support data-informed thinking. In my own organization, I have seen how leadership’s interest can make the difference between a forgotten report and a fully integrated decision-making tool. Our leadership's commitment to customer feedback resulted in an entirely new customer survey process we rolled out this year, with closed loop feedback and in-depth analytics about the customer journey.\nThis made me reflect on how often organizations treat analytics as a technical upgrade instead of a cultural shift. The idea that it is not about the data itself, but how people use it, aligns with my experience. So my question is: how do organizations best transition from seeing analytics as a side project to making it a core part of strategy, especially when cultural resistance is high?"

One example of a company that I can think of that does this is Selkirk. Selkirk is one of the top pickleball brands in the country, and they released several paddles with holes in the throat. They advertised it as being more aerodynamic and helping achieve lightning-fast hands, but in reality, it does nothing.

I am currently in the beginning stages of a data collection project with my employer. I would like to share this with you all and hear your thoughts on it:\nWe are completing a large inventory across our local organization with the goal of documenting every piece of calibrated equipment with the goal of directly linking each tool with the asset it was used on. Before this endeavor, we had no way of tracking which tools were used on which asset. Often times, when one of our calibrated tools goes in for a calibration cycle, we get a notice indicating it was found out of tolerance (OOT). Whenever an OOT notification comes in, our engineering department must do a risk analysis to determine if we need to issue a recall on the assets that may have been affected. Without the data directly linking the tools to assets, it is extremely hard to determine which assets may be affected.\nIn this case, this data is essential to speeding up the risk analysis process, we would be able to quickly identify which assets may be affected and determine if it poses a risk to aircraft or manpower. The speedy risk analysis process would allow our department to reallocate resources to other projects that will directly impact production by increasing throughput.\nI also imagine that this data will prove useful in predicting when a tool will be found out of tolerance. Currently, calibration cycles are determined by the calendar; it is quite possible that the primary factor for tools falling out of calibration is usage, not time. If we were able to track how much a tool is used between calibration cycles and compare that to when an OOT is issued, we may be able to adjust calibration cycles and reduce down time for our machines and production lines. It is already known that the single greatest constraint to our production lines is calibration cycles. Reducing the number of needed calibration cycles would increase productivity. Predicting when a tool will fall out of calibration will also help eliminate the potential for product recalls, as the tool in question could be sent for a calibration before it falls out of tolerance.\nThis data should prove useful in increasing profit for my organization. When the inventory is complete, at the very least, we will have the foundation to springboard other data collection. Other ideas I have had with this data and for future data collection is determining the degree to which age and wear are affecting our machine capacity, getting insight into which machine(s) are being fully utilized, and potentially predicting when machines will need to be replaced or upgraded.\nIt is fascinating to me how a small increase in data collection capability could provide the information needed make decisions concerning so many different aspects of production."

I believe it’s similar to tennis—sometimes, a new update is just a new color, and people think it will improve their game, even though the racquet's mechanics haven’t changed at all. Companies analyze data to identify trends and understand where people are most likely to boost their purchasing behavior, allowing them to achieve higher profits."

Quite often coaches will delay making a decision, in hopes to get more information to support the decision, or to aid in making a more specific decision. This often leads to allowing opponents additional time to exploit vulnerability, or own team running out of time to make an effective adjustment."

Also I have seen when having the right data can change behavior and help make right decisions. In my younger years I played lots of video games. My wife didn't like this, and I had a feeling that I should probably reign it in, but I kept telling myself that it was all under control. Nothing changed until I determined I wanted to write a novel, something I had always dreamed of doing. But where would I find the time? I decided that if I had time to play video games, I probably had time to write a novel. So I started tracking how much time I spent playing video games each day. I was shocked when the numbers came back so high. I had no idea I was playing as much as I was. I remember a particular day when I had worked an 8-hour day and then had played video games for 8 hours. Having the tangible numbers that I collected myself -- the cold, hard data -- shocked me into giving up video games for activities that were more important to me. Data is powerful. \nThanks!"

I've seen this play out in organizations where I've worked. One example I thought I would share happened at a company that only allowed Mac computers to a small and select few employees in creative fields, because they are \"too expensive.\" This belief was held across the entire organization. It wasn't until I created a comparison table that showed prices of the dell computers they were used to buying along side comparable Mac computers that they finally believed that the Mac computers were cheaper. I think it must be human nature that we have assumptions that we don't verify. It's also interesting how showing the data takes away arguments and changes minds quicker and easier than other arguments. \nWhat are some examples you've seen where having data has changed minds and behavior?"

I think most organizations understand that their data will rarely be perfect, so the focus shifts to determining whether the information is “good enough” to support a well-reasoned decision. This often involves assessing the reliability, timeliness, and completeness of the data in the context of the decision being made. While some companies use formal frameworks or internal benchmarks to evaluate data quality, much of the judgment still depends on experience and the specific circumstances. In fast-paced environments, waiting for perfect data can mean missing valuable opportunities. Which means many organizations are willing to move forward with the best available information, while building in flexibility to adjust their strategy as new data comes to light."

The chapter emphasizes how straightforward her approach was, and yet it still had a major impact.\nIt really got me thinking about work and life in general, and how much more we could achieve by better understanding how to measure things. I tend to overcomplicate problems, but this reminded me that starting with what I already know and applying the simplest possible solution can often take me a long way.\nIn my work, quantifying information seems to be a constant need and I can see how approaching measurement challenges with a simple mindset, and asking basic questions first could lead to quicker, more effective solutions.\nQuestion:\nWhat does Emily Rosa's story tell us about the value of curiosity and asking basic questions, even in professional settings?"

They utilized a watermark in their reports that would only exist if the reports were being used directly from their system, as soon as you download the data that the watermark would be lost. They would only add the watermark to their data that had been verified through auditing. This is just one example of how we can make sure that our data is clean and accurate, it helps to keep things from being tampered with as easily and allows people to reference the data knowing that it is accurate, they even reference a time where individuals were arguing because of partial data and other corrected them and showed a report that contains the data set."

I like how there was discussion on the quantifying of intangible data. This is very common when trying to weigh the feature benefits of a new product or the value of a new release. It is difficult to quantify things like perceived customer value, but doing so can radically influence decisions. For example, I know of a product release that did not meet a significant amount of the required competitive features in that market and it failed. The perceived value of the feature set to the customer was not properly evaluated and thus led to the low success of the product. Quantifying intangible data can have vast consequences like shown previously and I am interested in learning if others have found methods they believe are successful in doing so."

Your example from the Space Dynamics Laboratory highlights how even technically rich environments can benefit from better alignment between analytics efforts and strategic goals. As a mid-level manager I think you raise an excellent question. One practical strategy I've seen work well is embedding data literacy training into leadership development programs.

We are still trying to figure out what data is the most important, how to incorporate it and how to present it to senior leadership currently. To increase our efficiency with our data, I think we need to have multiple data stewards; we currently only have a total of two stewards that present data for their specific workflows however, we have found that the analytics are very surface level, and the information can be found from anyone that looks at the data.

In this smaller company, most of our data is used solely for basic reporting, and analytics isn’t really driving strategy—ownership tends to rely on what has always worked in the past.\nThat said, we’ve started experimenting with simple visuals—like job cost dashboards in our accounting software and project variance reports—to help leadership and estimators get more comfortable using data.

This allowed us to track key performance metrics across departments in a centralized dashboard, giving both sales and leadership real-time visibility into project profitability, pipeline status, and customer alignment. This transformation not only improved operational efficiency, but also empowered data-driven decision-making across departments.

However, after reflecting on the above post, I have now realized that it can help to complement data-driven approaches rather than disregard them. Thinking more into it, I believe that there could be a great mix of utilizing the knowledge of past data (whatever is in their memory, no research needed) and quick effective decisions with reasonable approximation. Although this will not always work considering everyone cannot remember numbers off of the top of their head, I believe this would apply to those companies that rely too heavily on data within some industries. \nThank you for providing this article, I think it provides a great deal of information on the Fermi estimation. Although it is meant to be useful for the reasons stated in your post, it is important to remember what is still needed for this skill to be successful in the slightest. You provided a great description of what it means to utilize the Fermi estimation, which are things like critical thinking and logical reasoning. I believe that it is important for others to be able to distinguish between different types of reasoning—such as suggestions, educated guesses, and Fermi estimations—especially when considering conclusions that are not solely based on data analytics.\n \nThis was a great post, and I truly appreciate you sharing your thoughts!"

You need people who care about using it the right way, clear goals, and support from leaders and coworkers who use it.\nChapter 2 also made me think about how much we overlook where data comes from or how it’s stored. It’s not just about grabbing numbers from a spreadsheet. If data isn’t structured well or easy to access, it won’t help anyone. I wonder how many companies think they’re “data-driven” but are still stuck in stage 1 or 2 without even knowing it.\nWhat stage do you think your company or team is at in the organization progress?"

I think you're right that people can get so caught up in the imperfections that they miss the bigger picture. In my work, I’ve seen how even slightly messy data gets tossed aside, even if it still has value. It makes me wonder if we’re limiting ourselves by demanding perfection before we act."

        "content": "Hi Deron, Planning an event of size is an incredible undertaking.  I loved seeing how you referenced the value-of-information steps from How to Measure Anything.  I can see the greatest risks being head-count and if people who showed interest actually arrived and participated so you can recoup the costs of putting on the event. I once attended a conference where the hosts were expecting hundreds of attendees, so they rented an incredible space and invested thousands of dollars into putting the event on for only 30 or so people to attend.  In order for the event to not feel like a total failure to those that travelled to be there they emptied their offices and sent every employee to the conference to make it feel and look more full.  It's a very depressing place to be in. There are great ways to mitigate that risk -- but there are also other ways to define success. On the other hand, I have been to events where they knew that if they even made one sale or gained one new customer the entire operation is worth it.   So make sure success is clearly defined and then poll your guests to understand what value they were looking for most out of this conference experience. Best of luck! I look forward to continuing to learn from you."

Maybe it was because I just returned home from my sons little league game, or maybe because of the references in that chapter - but I really believe data and analytics have really changed the game of baseball. When the author mentioned that analytics should \"start with the decision, not the dataset\", I thought about the room of scouts sitting with Billy Beane and Billy changing their method of scouting from who LOOKS like a star or who has the confidence to succeed in the majors because they have a beautiful girlfriend to which on-base metrics predict wins and \"who gets on base\".  Forbes notes in this article (Moneyball 20 Years Later: A Progress Report On Data And Analytics In Professional Sports\n    \n\nLinks to an external site.) that twenty ears after that Oakland Athletics team flipped the script on baseball nearly ever pro-sports team has copied that \"decision-first\" playbook. \nI should also highlight one of my favorite quotes so far from the chapters, when The Scottish writer Andrew Lang commented, “Statistics are often used as a drunken man uses a lamppost—for support rather than illumination.” Hilarious comparison (I wish I could quip like this), but true when you think that so many people only go get data to support their narrative, instead of humbly bending to whatever the un-bias data says. So here is an open ended question for you - when was the last time you saw data manipulated in a way as to prop-up or support the story-tellers narrative? My first answer - political polls.... but we can save politics for another class."

        "content": "The first two chapters of Analytics at Work opened my eyes to the different ways analytics can be approached. I strongly support the authors’ viewpoint on data vs feelings, especially when considering the context of stock market investing. In the stock market, there are often two types of investors: those who rely on “vibes” and those who utilize data-driven analysis. The latter group tends to make more consistent and profitable choices. This supports the authors’ claim that data-backed decisions reduce risks and yield better outcomes. For example, firms like Renaissance Technologies, which employ sophisticated algorithms and data models, regularly outcompete investors who rely more on sentiment or intuition.\nOn the other hand, those who invest based on market “hype” or social media trends often face significant losses when the hype dies down or proves inaccurate. The rise and fall of meme stocks, like GameStop, demonstrated that those who invested purely based on online excitement rather than evaluating fundamental data frequently lost money when the market corrected itself. This real-world example aligns with the authors’ argument that using systematic data analysis to inform decisions is more sustainable. While there will always be opportunities to get lucky with meme coins or viral stocks, quantitative analysts have data to back up their choices."

This makes it easier for everyone involved to align more quickly and with less conflict.\nDuring a stressful transition at work, I was paired with a new partner, and I felt like I was doing most of the work, which left me burned out. It was hard to show this to our manager without seeming subjective. So, I worked with our software application team to develop a Power BI dashboard for our workflow. It tracked how many items were received and who handled what. The visual charts and graphs made it easy to see the workload distribution.\nThis data helped us have fact-based conversations instead of emotional ones. It reduced conflict and made our discussions more constructive.\nIn How to Measure Anything, Chapter One, Page 3, begins with a quote that really resonated with me:\n\"When you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it; but when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meager and unsatisfactory kind; it may be the beginning of knowledge, but you have scarcely in your thoughts advanced to the state of science.\" —Lord Kelvin (1824–1907), British physicist and member of the House of Lords"

Davenport, Jeanne G. Harris, and Robert Morison. The book lists four typical decision-making errors: 1. not asking the right questions; 2. making incorrect assumptions and failing to test them; 3. using analytics to justify what you want instead of letting facts guide you to the correct answer; and 4. failing to take the time to understand all the alternatives or interrupt the data correctly.\nThese four points have brought attention to my decision-making and how often I fail to take the time to consider each point thoroughly. Lately, I have been faced with significant decisions and have felt uncertain about how to proceed. These four points have given me a sense of direction on what to consider when facing a decision. I have not taken the time to ask the right questions or understand all the alternatives completely, which has led me to make poor decisions."

I appreciate your perspectives, as I am getting into Digital Marketing through this MBA program and my job, and now am just starting to realize how much of my digital profile is tracked and used for advertising. Data management is very important in engineering (especially defense), but besides technical data my company doesn't have a process for management.\n1. I read your statement as a conflict between your personal and career perspectives: choosing to opt-out vs. wishing customer opted-in. I've also asked a similar question about how much data we should be able to collect from customers, so I'll focus on your question comparing in-person sales vs. targeted ads. In my mind, the difference between the scenarios described would be the in-person sales rep only knows as much about you as you are willing to tell them right then, perhaps with the addition of the car you drove or the store you came from. I'm not sure how deep digital tracking can go, but to create an analogy, the marketer at least knows where you've been today, they have a good idea of your demographics, and they can make educated guesses about why you came into the store. I think that would be a very odd interaction to have in person!\n2. The last class I took as part of this MBA program was on executive influence and strategy, and a big part of it was how to convince company leadership to consider your proposals. For your situation, as an employee, I think it would be helpful to start finding decisions or questions in your silo that can be answered or improved with data from other silos. Building a cross-disciplinary team to share data with using whatever informal or clunky means at your disposal could also create a team of believers, giving you more support when you go to leadership and present your case."

However, my role at work is now changing and the data I work with sometimes includes the types of customer data mentioned in the text. Unlike in engineering, where all the data I could want is already out there (or could be if I run some experiments on metals or processes), the data here is personal and relates to individuals. This data is much softer, but more importantly, must be collected with permission. I appreciated that the text emphasized following laws and standards in gathering data about customers, but I wonder where the ethical line is and how we should define it. Most of us opt-in to targeted advertising on our computers and devices so we see ads of stuff we might be interested in, but where should that stop? Should we permit companies to gather all of our data, create models and analysis based on it, and predict our next desires, health outcomes, criminal activity? I don't know where American privacy law steps in already, but I look forward to learning more from you all about customer data and what we can and can't do with it."

I thought an important aspect of this reading was the emphasis on data integration, and ensuring the data you collect and analyze will have a direct impact on the company. This made me think of how my employer, who manages large amounts of contracts, could benefit from actually analyzing the data collected in our system. This would help the team become more productive and efficient and allow them to be ahead of issues rather than constantly trying to solve issues after they’ve occurred. For example, data collection and analysis of end/renewal dates of contracts would be a great way to minimize delays.\nQuestion: Not every business has the time, money, or staff to effectively manage and analyze data. How can smaller organizations still use analytics in a way that makes sense for them?"

That kind of transparency gives you leverage and also protects your business from decisions based on assumptions. At Pick PT, we’ve considered analyzing reimbursement patterns by payer as well, but your post makes me think we should accelerate that project.

It’s not enough to invest in tools or data; leaders need to consistently model and reinforce data-driven thinking across all levels of the organization. The DELTA model helps clarify how enterprise focus and leadership must work together to embed analytics into daily decisions. At Pick PT, we’ve implemented basic EHR reporting tools, but without strong leadership direction, they’re often overlooked in strategy meetings. I believe this shows how analytics can fail to deliver value if they’re treated as an add-on rather than a core part of operations. I’ve seen larger companies like Amazon use analytics not just for optimization but to drive their entire culture and decision-making process. This makes me wonder: how can small businesses begin building a data-driven culture with limited resources and staff?"

I like the quote in the book from Socrates that \"The unexamined life is not worth living.\"  I think that if we should always spend substantial thought examining the information/data that we are getting and think of it from as unbiased perspectives as possible.  Sometimes that requires removing our emotions and viewing the information in separate instances where we know we aren't letting emotion interfere.  Over time you can build your own personal trust and to me that is the data you can count on most if available."

But maybe there are other data points in that pool that may create causation. In the book, we see how they compare credit scores and car crashes. I wonder what other intangibles or metrics fall into the correlation of those data points. Just because someone pays their bills does not make them a good driver. For example, maybe because they pay their bills, they are more often law-abiding citizens who are not going out and driving crazy, leading to more wrecks?\nIn your field, I see a similar dilemma. We may think that high physical stress will require more prescriptions for pharmaceuticals due to a higher risk of injury. But people doing those activities tend to be healthier because of their active lifestyle, requiring less. You could potentially use this data to predict the types of medications they may need. The active person will need prescriptions that correlate to physical therapy, where the others may need things for back pain from sitting at a desk all day, anti-depressants because they don’t destress with physical activity, or high blood pressure from a lack of exercise.\nBeing in the military, I noticed that the people who were in great shape and did lots of physical activities tended to go to the doctor the least. Where the people who barely passed their physical fitness tests seemingly were always going to medical for injuries.\nFascinating observation, I’m curious to see what others have to say on this."

I agree with the need for high-quality data, its analysis, and integrating it to improve strategic objectives. Companies that are not using data are at a disadvantage. I feel that the more data-driven we go, the more it can hurt the workers. Many companies track and assess their workers on so many metrics that determine their longevity at the company based on how they perform under those measurements against their peers. At Amazon, employees have their bathroom breaks timed, as that was a piece of data the company saw as a loss and worked on a way to reduce the loss of labor hours from it. When we move into the future, I feel that it comes down to the leadership to make good decisions with the data they choose to use and how it will affect the culture and climate at the organization. There is no doubt that the more you can effectively use data can and will increase profits by minimizing waste and optimizing aspects of the business. But, when it goes too far that the employees have to constantly live in fear that they need to hit certain marks on so many metrics, then the company is at risk of having high employee turnover, which incurs new costs that were not seen when trying to use data to optimize.\nHow do you feel about how leadership plays a critical role in integrating data and analytics while still building a company culture that people want to work for?"

        "content": "After reading Chapters 1 and 2 of How to Measure Anything by Douglas W. Hubbard, what really stood out to me was the idea that anything can be measured, even things we think are intangible like customer satisfaction or employee morale. Hubbard’s point that the main barrier to measurement is our own uncertainty, not the nature of the thing itself, was eye-opening. It made me rethink how often we say something can’t be measured just because we don’t know how.\nA good example is how Amazon uses customer data to measure satisfaction. By analyzing browsing history and feedback, they can quantify how happy a customer is and adjust their strategies. This shows how even something as subjective as satisfaction can be turned into measurable data.\nI found a great article from Harvard Business Review called you cant manage what you cant measure. It reinforces Hubbard’s point by discussing how data-driven decisions help companies perform better. It’s a reminder that just because something is hard to measure doesn’t mean it isn’t worth trying.\nOne thing I’m still thinking about is how precise we really need to be when measuring intangibles. Hubbard suggests that even rough estimates can be useful, but how do we know when “good enough” data is actually good enough? For example, if a company wants to measure employee morale, is a quarterly survey sufficient, or would more frequent checks be more effective? Where do we draw the line between too little and too much data?"

In my group (operations), I want people to know 1. what they should be working on, and 2. if they are being effective. In some cases, we have built models that are predictive but these are largely around forecasting. We use Power BI for most of our reporting as the canned reports within the ERP system are \"least-best\" for our needs. Our homemade reports are often compelling and benefit accounting, finance, sales, and operations. The first hurdle has been getting everyone to use them, read the data similarly, and ask questions that drive meaningful action. This training has greatly impacted our ability to streamline meetings and focus on what we must do to drive revenue."

        "content": "The concept of data integration (page 29) is something that we need to emphasize in my workplace. We have a robust ERP system with the capability to retain large amounts of data. Unfortunately, we also utilize a separate time clock system for our W-2 employees. On top of this, our staffing agency uses a third system for their associate timekeeping activities. In the context of labor management for a manufactured item, we are failing to adequately track the labor, per work order, that is applied to a given product.\nThis disconnect between systems makes it hard for us to get clear, accurate information when we need it. The book Analytics at Work points out that when data isn't connected, it stays stuck in silos, and that’s exactly what’s happening here. We can see how many labor hours we paid for, but we can’t easily tie those hours to specific jobs, shifts, or work orders. That means we can’t really measure how efficient our labor is, understand where we’re losing time or money, or pinpoint problem areas. To fix this, we need to make sure our systems can talk to each other, whether that’s through software connections, a shared data hub, or common reporting methods. Once we get everything on the same page, we’ll be able to track labor more accurately, know our true costs, and make better decisions based on the full picture."

Having data is only part of the equation; it's how you interpret and act on that data that matters most. The 2007 housing crisis is a textbook case of misaligned incentives overriding strong, pointed analytics. Many institutions had access to risk indicators, but either ignored them or failed to ask the right questions. Your example of Wells Fargo is a great contrast: it shows that disciplined, long-term thinking rooted in analytics can protect a company even when it means going against the crowd. It’s a reminder that data-informed decisions require not just tools and dashboards, but also leadership willing to prioritize long-term value over short-term wins."

We now know that financial institutions at the time ignored important data and made risky assumptions that ended up with huge consequences. What we learn is that having data isn’t enough, you need to analyze it and use it wisely.  Without clear intention and purpose behind how you look at the data and analytics it is easy to miss the bigger picture or draw the wrong conclusions. An example of this was Wells Fargo, they did the right thing by staying cautious during the housing boom (Davenport, Harris, & Morison, 2010) . They took a temporary hit, but their CEO understood the long-term analytics and made decisions that helped the company thrive through the storm. It can be easy for businesses to focus only on short-term gains or cash flows but looking at the long-term picture through solid analytics can make all the difference. In the end, it is about making smart, data informed choices- not just quick wins.\nDavenport, T. H., Harris, J. G., & Morison, R. (2010). Analytics at work: Smarter decisions, better results.

One word that I would use to describe data at my work is siloed. Each department has a different way that we look at and collect data. It has caused unnecessary tests to be ran, money to be spent and time to be lost. We are getting better, but it is hard to see/hear that an unnecessary test was ran to gather data that was already gathered. It is interesting that sometimes the hardest part of a company is not to make a quality product but to communicate basic information."

I never thought too hard about whether our scorecard could be improved until reading this section of the book. While the scorecard provides some data analysis (for example, 95% of clients say we are responsive to their needs), it doesn't put the analytics to work in my opinion to explain why we are meeting some goals and more importantly, why we aren't meeting other goals. Clearly, my firm is acquiring data (as they should) to calculate these metrics, but I see room for improvement regarding analytical capabilities and taking these metrics (especially the metrics that are poor) to another level to improve the firm as a whole. One area in this arena that my company does well in is applying ethnography through meeting with clients in informal client feedback interviews. Hearing directly from clients identifies problems that they may have with our deliverables, teams, QC process, communication, and more.\nMy firm hired a \"Business Intelligence Solutions Analyst\" in the last year. As far as I know, this is the first time we have had someone in this position at the firm. I am now curious to learn more about what type of analytics he is using and what models he may be building to help us hit our targets. I will plan to meet with him in the near future. After reading the text, I think this position is a prime opportunity to dig deeper into the uniqueness of data and identify a competitive advantage for the firm to add to our existing advantages."

Engineers will spend hours upon hours creating elaborate spreadsheets and models with advanced software in order to make a calculation or QC someone's work. I will say that sometimes the spreadsheets/models are needed, but certainly not every time. There are plenty of instances where the old school way of using paper, pencil, and a calculator will get you what you need in under an hour. Not only is it a simpler method, but it is cheap and fast. Time = money and the more time we spend getting fancy with our measurements when it wasn't needed, the more time lost that could have been spent on another project or in another positive way at the firm."

        "content": "Problem Introduction\nI support a conference that takes place each year in early June. Typically, the conference attracts 125-150 participants who come from around the United States and some foreign countries. Many of the participants who typically attend are finding it hard this year to travel due to the uncertainty of funding.  \nBackground\nThe conference, called Calcon, discusses issues related to testing and calibration of space sensors. The definition of calibration, in this context, is testing and verification that a spacecraft payload will work once it begins operation after reaching space. The conference is very technical and caters to researchers, scientists, and engineers in their field. Many presentations are highly technical.\nMeasurement Challenges\nThe issue from a conference standpoint is knowing how to plan for the event. How many people will attend this year? Although the number of attendees varies from year to year, there is a base population that seems to attend. Trying to plan for catering, venue, program and accommodations is extremely difficult and very fluid. Due to government policy and limited budgets many presenters are willing but unable to commit to attending. How do we forecast/predict/measure how many people will attend and what the program will look? From the text, How to measure anything, the question is posed of the impact of research productivity if Calcon and other conferences close due lack of participation? What is the value of information that is being presented at Calcon?\nFollowing the information economics approach (pg 9, How to measure anything), here is a decision that we are moving forward with: 1) Define the decision: We needed to decide if it was important to hold Calcon in 2025. 2) Determine what you know now: We have the key elements in place to hold the conference. Key elements include, keynote speaker, workshop, program presenters, and sponsors. 3) Compute the value of additional information: As time goes on, we will be able to measure pre-registrations and know who is planning to attend. 4) Measure where information value is high: Registration numbers need to be tracked closely to see how much below normal averages that we are sitting at. 5) Make a decision and act on it: We made the decision to move forward with Calcon 2025. It is a significant risk in the short term but possibly helpful long term."

Thanks for your link to the Money ball report on data and analytics in professional sports. I believe that there are many activities that we participate in where data would help to productively make better decisions. Sports are one example but work is another. Figuring out how to make measurements that lead to productivity improvements are important for a company to succeed and to help employees to be more productive.\nPer your question, I often see data manipulated when dealing with construction companies. It seems that you are led to choosing certain options because other ones would be “just too expensive” to consider or “can’t be done”. I believe that many times that the construction folks were honest in their estimates. They have experience and know what they can do easily and profitably.  In other situations, I think that there was no data to back up the claims. Or the data are manipulated to fit the profile of the person performing the work. I often times find myself asking the question, “How much extra would it really cost to do things that were suggested?” “How could we get some data to compare?” “Are alternatives available that we haven’t considered yet?” Nice question."

While intuition is shaped by experience, it’s also limited by personal bias and lacks the scalability that data analytics provides. For example, companies like Amazon use predictive analytics to anticipate customer needs and tailor marketing efforts, something no gut feeling could replicate with the same accuracy. As discussed in our book, data-driven organizations outperform those that lean on instinct by grounding decisions in evidence, identifying trends, and reducing uncertainty. Embedding analytics into everyday decision-making not only increases efficiency but also helps leaders avoid costly assumptions—making data not just helpful, but essential. I think this is paramount and something I am guilty of doing in the past (relying solely on intuition and brushing aside data). \nMy question is this - How can an individual measure something like confidence or expected/anticipated success? I feel this would lower anxiety levels for students around the world as well as employees."

This is my response for Analytics at Work. \nOne idea from Chapters 1 and 2 that stood out to me was the “DELTA model” for building an analytical capability in an organization. I found the emphasis on leadership to be especially relevant—how analytics success doesn’t start with technology, but with people at the top valuing data-driven decision-making. This reminded me of a past experience working with a small HVAC company that wanted to streamline their service calls. They had the software to track data, but it wasn’t until a new manager came in and prioritized actually using that data (rather than relying solely on gut instincts) that we saw real change—better route optimization, reduced fuel costs, and more accurate scheduling. It made me realize that without executive buy-in, analytics is just data sitting in a dashboard.I found this article, \"Six Must-Have Mindsets to be a World-Class Data and Analytics Leader\"\n    \n\nLinks to an external site.  from the International Institute for Analytic. It delves further into the 'L' in the DELTA model—Leadership—and emphasizes that effective analytical leadership isn't confined to top executives; it extends to managers and individual contributors who champion data-driven decision-making. The article outlines six essential mindsets for analytics leaders, including being enterprise-minded, acting as change agents, and fostering a growth mindset. These insights underscore that successful analytics initiatives require leaders who can bridge the gap between data and actionable business strategies. \nOpen-ended Question:How do we encourage skeptical or non-data-oriented leaders to see the value of analytics when their instincts or legacy practices have \"worked\" for so long?"

Personally, I think the answer often depends on the industry and organizational culture. Some sectors, like logistics, e-commerce, or finance, can thrive with analytics deeply embedded into every decision. Others might benefit from a more balanced approach that leaves room for intuition, creativity, and flexibility, especially in roles like marketing or design.\nWhat do you think makes a company ready to make the leap toward becoming an analytical competitor?

You will have to guide it, teach it, and check it, but it will ultimately help with the workload and get you to your goal with far less effort. I feel your article presented this very thing. AI is a tool that presents an opportunity for forward movement and growth. Using AI in its early years will ensure that the company is successfully utilizing it in the years to come. Ultimately, the hesitation and fear of AI will prevent desirable and long-sustained results, which is something no company wants. \nI had also reviewed the importance of high-quality data, and it became very clear to me that small errors along a chain of data can create massive impacts on data usage and company trajectory. Using AI, I do feel it presents an exciting opportunity to check and maintain the high-quality data that a company needs for success. Perhaps the thought that many companies have is that the early users will be experiencing the major issues, and there is a fear of being the first to fail because of the use of AI. I can appreciate that the misuse of AI could create issues. However, I've never thought it prudent to be afraid of something you don't understand, it is simply an opportunity to learn."

We can't measure everything in business with a ruler so sometimes we have to make a new ruler. \nHaving a standard to measure against makes it so everyone is evaluating on the same scale and makes your data more predictable. We also gave everyone access to the data so it was more transparent and one person couldn't manipulate it before running reports."

        "content": "As I read it reminded me of an internship I had a few years ago for a solar company. I was thinking about how I've used data in the past and how I've seen other companies use it. I was an intern in the Supply Chain department and saw that during the install of solar jobs some parts were missing and some parts were in excess. This led to wasted time because the installers were waiting on parts and had to make return visits. This also caused errors in ordering too much of particular materials and having surplus that now had to be tracked. Taking the data I reviewed every bill of materials to ensure it matched with what was needed for the install. I found critical errors in the tool we were using to automatically calculate parts and worked to fix that tool. By the end of the internship we had corrected quite a few of the material discrepancies and calculated the savings to be around $880k per yer. We could only fix the problem once we had data that showed errors and gave us a direction to look to fix the issues."
