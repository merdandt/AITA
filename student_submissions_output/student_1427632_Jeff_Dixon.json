      "content": "Did anyone else react with incredulity while reading this paragraph on p. 34 under \"Privacy\"? \nWhile the book is not on privacy, it's not beyond the scope to go a little deeper here. The concept of permission\nas relates to our data is technically true, but we as consumers, web users, etc. have to go to great lengths to \nexist outside of the reach of data harvesters. Our data gets sold and resold, we click through terms and conditions agreements all the time, and mostly just accept this fact as a part of enjoying all the conveniences and necessities we get from using the internet.\nHere's a story from 2020 where the reporter attempts to completely decouple themselves from Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, Google, and Apple. In sum, it was virtually impossible. https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/technology/blocking-the-tech-giants.html\n    \n\nLinks to an external site.\nAs professionals attempting to put analytics to work in our organizations, we might be at a competitive disadvantage if we chose\nto go beyond what's legal and customary, depending on our organization's objective. That's a real ethical question. Everyone's doing it, and collectively our individual privacy is being whittled away. When we get later in the course and realize that some information has great economic value to the firm, and that information is sensitive and/or personal (as it usually is), how to we grapple with it, if at all? \nThose are some thoughts. I thought the author could have been more rigorous and realistic with his treatment of the topic here."

      "content": "Hi Matt, This is such an important topic. In the Shingo MBA program and more broadly the Lean/Six Sigma world we talk a lot about Key Behavioral Indicators, which are the precursors to Key Performance Indicators.\nSo what observable (quantifiable) behaviors have a causal relationship with performance? If it's not immediately clear, we have to do a lot of observing, counting and then running statistical tests to figure it out. Once we do, we train on and attempt to integrate and standardize those behaviors into the work process with a mind toward making it easier to do the right behavior than the wrong one, along with a reliable way consistently measure those behaviors. As we know from HtMA, everything is tangible, and if a behavior strongly affects KPIs, the economic value of going to the trouble of measuring them should be worth it."
