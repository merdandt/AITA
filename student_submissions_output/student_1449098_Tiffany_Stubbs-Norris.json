      "content": "Alison,I really enjoyed the way you described the structure of analytics teams within your company. It sounds like a strong example of the DELTA model in action—specifically in how your organization prioritizes data infrastructure, technology, and analytics talent across departments. I also appreciated your point about how essential this is in fast-paced industries like food, where unexpected events (like tariffs or pandemics) can quickly shift the playing field.\nYour question about whether companies should become full-on analytical competitors versus using analytics as a support tool really made me pause. Personally, I think the answer often depends on the industry and organizational culture. Some sectors, like logistics, e-commerce, or finance, can thrive with analytics deeply embedded into every decision. Others might benefit from a more balanced approach that leaves room for intuition, creativity, and flexibility, especially in roles like marketing or design.\nWhat do you think makes a company ready to make the leap toward becoming an analytical competitor? Is it about tools, leadership, or something else?Great post!"

      "content": "*I realized after posting I had done HtMA, not AaW. This is my response for Analytics at Work. \nOne idea from Chapters 1 and 2 that stood out to me was the “DELTA model” for building an analytical capability in an organization. I found the emphasis on leadership to be especially relevant—how analytics success doesn’t start with technology, but with people at the top valuing data-driven decision-making. This reminded me of a past experience working with a small HVAC company that wanted to streamline their service calls. They had the software to track data, but it wasn’t until a new manager came in and prioritized actually using that data (rather than relying solely on gut instincts) that we saw real change—better route optimization, reduced fuel costs, and more accurate scheduling. It made me realize that without executive buy-in, analytics is just data sitting in a dashboard.I found this article, \"Six Must-Have Mindsets to be a World-Class Data and Analytics Leader\"\n    \n\nLinks to an external site.  from the International Institute for Analytic. It delves further into the 'L' in the DELTA model—Leadership—and emphasizes that effective analytical leadership isn't confined to top executives; it extends to managers and individual contributors who champion data-driven decision-making. The article outlines six essential mindsets for analytics leaders, including being enterprise-minded, acting as change agents, and fostering a growth mindset. These insights underscore that successful analytics initiatives require leaders who can bridge the gap between data and actionable business strategies. \nOpen-ended Question:How do we encourage skeptical or non-data-oriented leaders to see the value of analytics when their instincts or legacy practices have \"worked\" for so long?"
