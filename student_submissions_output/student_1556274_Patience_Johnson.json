      "content": "Hey Maegan,\nI hadn't even thought about individuals sabotoging the tests. It draws another question, is it worth doing these test sacrificing time an resources that could be used in other areas of the company to test for specific data when information that is good enough could be mined from other warehouses?"

      "content": "When I was reading, the materiels this week I knew I wanted to mention the experiement that Emily did. I though it was very clever. The part I wanted to touch on though was how willing the therapists were to help her, but how unwilling the were to help Jame Randi. The question that came to mind for me was, how can we build and test data when subjects are unwilling to help individuals who seem to have more purpose than a science fair or school project?Â \nAnother thing that I thought was interesting was how progressive was able to determine the likelyhood of someone crashing their car based on their credit score. That was a crazy concept to me about the power that our personal spending and repayment habits can have in determining our precentage of getting in a wreck. Working in hospitality, I think these methods could help determine our target demographic. Knowing we are a midscale hotel, this may help us find ways to market to a larger demographic with stretegic pricing strategies."

      "content": "Hey Dominick,\nWhen I initially read your post I was thinking about cultural resistance, and how I feel like people are unwilling to submit information for data collection, but then I realized you were talking about internal cultural resistance. I personally have to analyze data regularly to identify travel trends and demorgraphics. It isn't my favorite things to do, but seeing the results of that effort pays off. Seeing an increase in sales leading to an overall increase in revenue shows me the value of using data to detemine pricing strategies and promotions, as well as labor hours and operational overhead costs. I think the best way to transition is through transparency. Letting people see the differences that analytics can have on an industry."
