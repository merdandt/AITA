      "content": "The first two chapters share how data-driven decision-making can give organizations an edge. For my career in Special Olympics and non-profit sector, this is extremely relevant. The organization collects a lot of data on athlete participation, volunteer hours, and program outcomes, but without a clear plan to use it, data can become overwhelming. This can lead to analysis paralysis, where too much information prevents effective decision-making. This shows that while data is valuable, having a clear strategy for using it is just as important.\nApplying the DELTA model at Special Olympics could mean using athlete data to identify areas for training improvement or to track program impact. For example, analyzing performance data could reveal which sports or programs need more resources or where additional support could have the most impact. This targeted approach could help allocate resources more effectively and support athlete development.\nA practical example of Special Olympics using data analytics is their partnership with SC&H Group for the 2020 Corporate Polar Plunge event. By utilizing Tableau for live analytics, they showcased their top donors and organizations, leading to over $490,000  and passing their $400,000 goal. This data-driven approach allowed Special Olympics Maryland to sponsor more than 1,900 athletes in events or experiences in 2020.\nOne question that came to mind while reading: How can Special Olympics encourage staff and volunteers to not just understand data but actually use it in everyday decisions? What kinds of training or resources could make data more accessible and actionable within the organization?"

      "content": "Hi Sharon! \nTo your question about how to ensure data is trustworthy, I believe it starts with understanding the source of the data. When organizations collect data, they need to evaluate the credibility and accuracy of their sources. This could mean working with reputable vendors, using standard data collection processes, and using quality control checks to identify errors. One method could be cross-referencing it against other trusted data points to verify its accuracy. When organizations commit to thorough data verification and governance, they set themselves up to make decisions that benefit their goals and long term success!"
