      "content": "Like many others, I have often fallen into the \"analysis paralysis\" trap - where I hesitate to make a decision because I feel like I don't have sufficient information. In theÂ Data chapter of Analytics at Work, the authors introduced an idea they named the \"10 percent solution.\" This solution describes a shortcut for running analysis by using only 10 percent of the available data. While this is described as an \"early step\" for most companies, I believe it could also operate as a successful heuristic for common decisions.\nFor example, a few years ago I had money that I wanted to invest. I spent about a year talking to dozens of people about how they invested their money. I read articles and watched videos on YouTube. At the end of the day, my delay in making a decision almost certainly cost me money I could have earned by investing earlier. If I had applied the 10 percent solution, I would have felt like I had enough information to make a decision in about a month instead of a year."

      "content": "Jacob,\nThis is an exciting success story about the power of analytics in improving business! I had a similar experience using data in an engineering internship. By analyzing variance data on a manufacturing process, we discovered that one of our steps was creating a disproportionate number of problems. By focusing efforts on improving that step, we were able to reduce errors significantly and save about $77k annually. I would've been over the moon to save $880k! That's phenomenal. And I completely agree - it's almost impossible to fix a problem until you know what the problem is. Careful analysis of the data is a great way to discover what the problems are."
