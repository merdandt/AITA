      "content": "Hey Kalvin, \nIt's astonishing to me that, with something as simple as pulling school information, there can be so much inaccurate data. This leads to information that affects results, makes it challenging, and must be very frustrating for you. \nTo answer your question, and also mirror what McKay has said. It depends on how important and accurate the data needs to be. Is it worth paying extra money to have the most accurate data possible, or would money be better spent elsewhere? Does the company, in this case, the school district, have the extra money to spend on something like this?"

      "content": "Out of all the readings and lectures, what I found most interesting was Emily Rosa's therapeutic touch experiment. She tested professional therapeutic touch experts blindly to see if they guessed the hand she was hovering over. They all failed miserably.\nThe placebo effect is where people think something works, so it tricks their mind into seeing results. One example of a company that I can think of that does this is Selkirk. Selkirk is one of the top pickleball brands in the country, and they released several paddles with holes in the throat. They advertised it as being more aerodynamic and helping achieve lightning-fast hands, but in reality, it does nothing. This concept and the look of the paddle trick people into believing this paddle is going to make them play better, so they buy it and think there's a huge difference in their playing. However, nothing has changed about their playing, and the paddle has done nothing.\nWhat do you think about the placebo effect?"
