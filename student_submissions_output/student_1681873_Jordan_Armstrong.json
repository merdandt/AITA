      "content": "Hi Hunter.  If I am understanding your question correctly, you are asking how companies have utilized localized analytics to achieve coordinated efforts?  I can think of a pretty basic example where a friend's service industry company gathered data on the amount of single use plastics that it used.  It took this data and made a drastic change to only use reusable water bottles, food containers, and flatware.  This is a very simple example, but also a successful one!"

      "content": "In reading the list of decision-making errors in chapter 1 of Analytics at Work, one error stood out to me.  This was the error of postponing decisions because you are always dissatisfied with the data and analysis that you already have.  This happens a lot in engineering, and also in life.  Some reference the Churchill quote, “Perfection is the enemy of progress”, meaning that searching for more perfect or better data can paralyze a person, or an organization to inaction.  This is why it is important to fully define the data that you plan to gather before gathering it.  I have been on plenty of engineering teams where poorly defined data requirements prevent progress on a project."
