      "content": "Connor,\nI agree that uniqueness is an interesting topic. I work for a start up and for years we collected data on as much as we could. Over the years we have found out that not all data needs to be collected. Not all data is created equal, it is incumbent on each company to find what data is unique to them in their situation and how to best put it to work. If you do a deep search on companies with high market share, one thing that stick out, is that they all are good at collecting, and interpreting data well."

      "content": "The 2007 housing crisis mentioned on page 14 of the textbook shows what can happen when companies don’t use proper analytics (Davenport, Harris, & Morison, 2010). We now know that financial institutions at the time ignored important data and made risky assumptions that ended up with huge consequences. What we learn is that having data isn’t enough, you need to analyze it and use it wisely.  Without clear intention and purpose behind how you look at the data and analytics it is easy to miss the bigger picture or draw the wrong conclusions. An example of this was Wells Fargo, they did the right thing by staying cautious during the housing boom (Davenport, Harris, & Morison, 2010) . They took a temporary hit, but their CEO understood the long-term analytics and made decisions that helped the company thrive through the storm. It can be easy for businesses to focus only on short-term gains or cash flows but looking at the long-term picture through solid analytics can make all the difference. In the end, it is about making smart, data informed choices- not just quick wins.\nDavenport, T. H., Harris, J. G., & Morison, R. (2010). Analytics at work: Smarter decisions, better results.

      "content": "Carey,\nI am not going to lie I was excited to see we were placed in the same group. I like your post and it is something that is a sensitive subject for me. One word that I would use to describe data at my work is siloed. Each department has a different way that we look at and collect data. It has caused unnecessary tests to be ran, money to be spent and time to be lost. We are getting better, but it is hard to see/hear that an unnecessary test was ran to gather data that was already gathered. It is interesting that sometimes the hardest part of a company is not to make a quality product but to communicate basic information."
