I am currently in the beginning stages of a data collection project with my employer. I would like to share this with you all and hear your thoughts on it:\nWe are completing a large inventory across our local organization with the goal of documenting every piece of calibrated equipment with the goal of directly linking each tool with the asset it was used on. Before this endeavor, we had no way of tracking which tools were used on which asset. Often times, when one of our calibrated tools goes in for a calibration cycle, we get a notice indicating it was found out of tolerance (OOT). Whenever an OOT notification comes in, our engineering department must do a risk analysis to determine if we need to issue a recall on the assets that may have been affected. Without the data directly linking the tools to assets, it is extremely hard to determine which assets may be affected.\nIn this case, this data is essential to speeding up the risk analysis process, we would be able to quickly identify which assets may be affected and determine if it poses a risk to aircraft or manpower. The speedy risk analysis process would allow our department to reallocate resources to other projects that will directly impact production by increasing throughput.\nI also imagine that this data will prove useful in predicting when a tool will be found out of tolerance. Currently, calibration cycles are determined by the calendar; it is quite possible that the primary factor for tools falling out of calibration is usage, not time. If we were able to track how much a tool is used between calibration cycles and compare that to when an OOT is issued, we may be able to adjust calibration cycles and reduce down time for our machines and production lines. It is already known that the single greatest constraint to our production lines is calibration cycles. Reducing the number of needed calibration cycles would increase productivity. Predicting when a tool will fall out of calibration will also help eliminate the potential for product recalls, as the tool in question could be sent for a calibration before it falls out of tolerance.\nThis data should prove useful in increasing profit for my organization. When the inventory is complete, at the very least, we will have the foundation to springboard other data collection. Other ideas I have had with this data and for future data collection is determining the degree to which age and wear are affecting our machine capacity, getting insight into which machine(s) are being fully utilized, and potentially predicting when machines will need to be replaced or upgraded.\nIt is fascinating to me how a small increase in data collection capability could provide the information needed make decisions concerning so many different aspects of production."
