      "content": "Caden, very thoughtful remarks. The comparison of seemingly unrelated data and their relationships. It is a weird point where correlation does not always mean causation. But maybe there are other data points in that pool that may create causation. In the book, we see how they compare credit scores and car crashes. I wonder what other intangibles or metrics fall into the correlation of those data points. Just because someone pays their bills does not make them a good driver. For example, maybe because they pay their bills, they are more often law-abiding citizens who are not going out and driving crazy, leading to more wrecks?\nIn your field, I see a similar dilemma. We may think that high physical stress will require more prescriptions for pharmaceuticals due to a higher risk of injury. But people doing those activities tend to be healthier because of their active lifestyle, requiring less. You could potentially use this data to predict the types of medications they may need. The active person will need prescriptions that correlate to physical therapy, where the others may need things for back pain from sitting at a desk all day, anti-depressants because they don’t destress with physical activity, or high blood pressure from a lack of exercise.\nBeing in the military, I noticed that the people who were in great shape and did lots of physical activities tended to go to the doctor the least. Where the people who barely passed their physical fitness tests seemingly were always going to medical for injuries.\nFascinating observation, I’m curious to see what others have to say on this."

      "content": "Looking into chapter 1 at the DELTA framework and comparing that to other parts of Unit 1 talking about intangibles. I agree with the need for high-quality data, its analysis, and integrating it to improve strategic objectives. Companies that are not using data are at a disadvantage. I feel that the more data-driven we go, the more it can hurt the workers. Many companies track and assess their workers on so many metrics that determine their longevity at the company based on how they perform under those measurements against their peers. At Amazon, employees have their bathroom breaks timed, as that was a piece of data the company saw as a loss and worked on a way to reduce the loss of labor hours from it. When we move into the future, I feel that it comes down to the leadership to make good decisions with the data they choose to use and how it will affect the culture and climate at the organization. There is no doubt that the more you can effectively use data can and will increase profits by minimizing waste and optimizing aspects of the business. But, when it goes too far that the employees have to constantly live in fear that they need to hit certain marks on so many metrics, then the company is at risk of having high employee turnover, which incurs new costs that were not seen when trying to use data to optimize.\nHow do you feel about how leadership plays a critical role in integrating data and analytics while still building a company culture that people want to work for?"
