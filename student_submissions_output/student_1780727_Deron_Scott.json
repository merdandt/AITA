      "content": "Problem Introduction\nI support a conference that takes place each year in early June. Typically, the conference attracts 125-150 participants who come from around the United States and some foreign countries. Many of the participants who typically attend are finding it hard this year to travel due to the uncertainty of funding.  \nBackground\nThe conference, called Calcon, discusses issues related to testing and calibration of space sensors. The definition of calibration, in this context, is testing and verification that a spacecraft payload will work once it begins operation after reaching space. The conference is very technical and caters to researchers, scientists, and engineers in their field. Many presentations are highly technical.\nMeasurement Challenges\nThe issue from a conference standpoint is knowing how to plan for the event. How many people will attend this year? Although the number of attendees varies from year to year, there is a base population that seems to attend. Trying to plan for catering, venue, program and accommodations is extremely difficult and very fluid. Due to government policy and limited budgets many presenters are willing but unable to commit to attending. How do we forecast/predict/measure how many people will attend and what the program will look? From the text, How to measure anything, the question is posed of the impact of research productivity if Calcon and other conferences close due lack of participation? What is the value of information that is being presented at Calcon?\nFollowing the information economics approach (pg 9, How to measure anything), here is a decision that we are moving forward with: 1) Define the decision: We needed to decide if it was important to hold Calcon in 2025. 2) Determine what you know now: We have the key elements in place to hold the conference. Key elements include, keynote speaker, workshop, program presenters, and sponsors. 3) Compute the value of additional information: As time goes on, we will be able to measure pre-registrations and know who is planning to attend. 4) Measure where information value is high: Registration numbers need to be tracked closely to see how much below normal averages that we are sitting at. 5) Make a decision and act on it: We made the decision to move forward with Calcon 2025. It is a significant risk in the short term but possibly helpful long term."

      "content": "I liked the comparison to the Moneyball theme. I related to the scene of Billy Beane trying to change the minds with data rather than the traditional ways of making decisions. Thanks for your link to the Money ball report on data and analytics in professional sports. I believe that there are many activities that we participate in where data would help to productively make better decisions. Sports are one example but work is another. Figuring out how to make measurements that lead to productivity improvements are important for a company to succeed and to help employees to be more productive.\nPer your question, I often see data manipulated when dealing with construction companies. It seems that you are led to choosing certain options because other ones would be “just too expensive” to consider or “can’t be done”. I believe that many times that the construction folks were honest in their estimates. They have experience and know what they can do easily and profitably.  In other situations, I think that there was no data to back up the claims. Or the data are manipulated to fit the profile of the person performing the work. I often times find myself asking the question, “How much extra would it really cost to do things that were suggested?” “How could we get some data to compare?” “Are alternatives available that we haven’t considered yet?” Nice question."
