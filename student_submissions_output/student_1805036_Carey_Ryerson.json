      "content": "Matt,\nThanks for your post, specifically the question about the phase of maturity. We are at a solid Stage 3. We have the data and are now slowly trying to get it to be useful. In my group (operations), I want people to know 1. what they should be working on, and 2. if they are being effective. In some cases, we have built models that are predictive but these are largely around forecasting. We use Power BI for most of our reporting as the canned reports within the ERP system are \"least-best\" for our needs. Our homemade reports are often compelling and benefit accounting, finance, sales, and operations. The first hurdle has been getting everyone to use them, read the data similarly, and ask questions that drive meaningful action. This training has greatly impacted our ability to streamline meetings and focus on what we must do to drive revenue."

      "content": "The concept of data integration (page 29) is something that we need to emphasize in my workplace. We have a robust ERP system with the capability to retain large amounts of data. Unfortunately, we also utilize a separate time clock system for our W-2 employees. On top of this, our staffing agency uses a third system for their associate timekeeping activities. In the context of labor management for a manufactured item, we are failing to adequately track the labor, per work order, that is applied to a given product.\nThis disconnect between systems makes it hard for us to get clear, accurate information when we need it. The book Analytics at Work points out that when data isn't connected, it stays stuck in silos, and that’s exactly what’s happening here. We can see how many labor hours we paid for, but we can’t easily tie those hours to specific jobs, shifts, or work orders. That means we can’t really measure how efficient our labor is, understand where we’re losing time or money, or pinpoint problem areas. To fix this, we need to make sure our systems can talk to each other, whether that’s through software connections, a shared data hub, or common reporting methods. Once we get everything on the same page, we’ll be able to track labor more accurately, know our true costs, and make better decisions based on the full picture."

      "content": "Chris,I am honored to be grouped with you again and hope all is well!\nThat's a strong summary, and I agree entirely with your point. Having data is only part of the equation; it's how you interpret and act on that data that matters most. The 2007 housing crisis is a textbook case of misaligned incentives overriding strong, pointed analytics. Many institutions had access to risk indicators, but either ignored them or failed to ask the right questions. Your example of Wells Fargo is a great contrast: it shows that disciplined, long-term thinking rooted in analytics can protect a company even when it means going against the crowd. It’s a reminder that data-informed decisions require not just tools and dashboards, but also leadership willing to prioritize long-term value over short-term wins."
