      "content": "I wish my company had a whole team dedicated to fixing errors! I feel like we have a whole team dedicated to making them!Â  I would agree entering stuff right the first time is always the best approach but not always achievable I think the best way to support your answer besides investing more into data governance is to invest more into the employees. If you have a really talented employee I would rather pay more to keep them around and happy then rotate through multiple not as talented or careful employees. I have seen both sides of this coin in my career where company a cares more and has a super talented team and works well as a unit and I have seen companies where people are constantly let go or are quitting because it just is not worth it and they are always behind due to errors and mistakes."

      "content": "I agree with you, Garret. Data can be very tricky because it is such a nice and useful tool but can be fudged so easily. You can also use the same data to come to different outcomes depending on who is doing the work, who is looking at it, and what the end goal is. I have seen some pretty easy errors made in my time in the workforce as well. At my first accounting job ,the prior staff accountant was cutting corners and our numbers were way off after I fixed the data the executive team was quite happy because they thought they were spending way more on events for clients."

      "content": "I feel like the company i work for has the tools to use data effectively and does so in pockets of the company but I feel like we struggle with communication so much that we are on more of a localized level and there is no way we are using this data effectively. Being on the accounting team I feel like we are one of maybe three departments that use our data effectively. I feel like our marketing is niche and outdated and as a company as a whole we do not track much internal let alone external data when it comes to things that could give us an edge. We are one of the top competitors in our field and I am just wondering if the amount of hiring friends and family in the company is impacting growth and the flow of good ideas and communication because it feels like people know they cannot get fired and act like it. I wonder how much human emotion,relationships and honesty affect data and how well companies use it. The logic behind this is that I know for a fact we all have lied on surveys, or in the workplace or covered up a mistake or two in our careers but I wonder how these little seemingly harmless choices can mislead the company as a whole."
