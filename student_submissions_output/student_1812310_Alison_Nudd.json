      "content": "Within the first chapter, we see examples given of how beneficial it can be when practicing analytical tools in the workplace. More specifically, how it can allow a business to navigate through challenges like economic and marketplace shifts. This truly does allow current company standings, future outlooks, and past data that will allow more flexibility during times like these. When thinking about the food industry, this is crucial for any level of success when thinking about tariffs, pandemics, new competitors, expansions, etc. Without having this data readily available and analyzed, a company can sink really fast with no way back to the surface.\nWithin my current company, we have analyst groups within each of our main departments. This allows us to have up-to-date analytics that provide current standings, future outlooks, and historical overview. Our company utilizes many sources like Tableau, Power BI, SnowFlake, WMS, TMS, excel, and many other platforms. Our industry is really fast paced with large competitors, which leaves us no wiggle room to fall behind. The data analytics team provides us so much comfort in every area of the business, allowing us to stay in the top 3.\nThis is a really interesting read as it supports the ideas discussed above, further proving the impact/importance of data analytics in the business. It goes over how analytics can be used for growth, consumer behavior, competitiveness, predict trends, and handle unexpected events. Click Here!\n    \n\nLinks to an external site.\nAs discussed within chapter one, there is a great deal of uncertainty to whether companies want to be fully focused on analytics (analytical competitors) where some believe it should not be the whole company (decisions based on facts and analytics). Where do you stand on these matters, or if you are also in between, are there certain industries that would benefit more from one or the other?"

      "content": "Hey Natalie!\nYou provided such a wonderful post that portrayed a very important concept for when the Fermi estimation is truly crucial. After going through your whole reading, my mindset on this concept has changed quite a bit. Initially, I struggled to see how the Fermi estimation could be useful for individuals who rely entirely on data for every decision. However, after reflecting on the above post, I have now realized that it can help to complement data-driven approaches rather than disregard them. Thinking more into it, I believe that there could be a great mix of utilizing the knowledge of past data (whatever is in their memory, no research needed) and quick effective decisions with reasonable approximation. Although this will not always work considering everyone cannot remember numbers off of the top of their head, I believe this would apply to those companies that rely too heavily on data within some industries. \nThank you for providing this article, I think it provides a great deal of information on the Fermi estimation. Although it is meant to be useful for the reasons stated in your post, it is important to remember what is still needed for this skill to be successful in the slightest. You provided a great description of what it means to utilize the Fermi estimation, which are things like critical thinking and logical reasoning. I believe that it is important for others to be able to distinguish between different types of reasoning—such as suggestions, educated guesses, and Fermi estimations—especially when considering conclusions that are not solely based on data analytics.\n \nThis was a great post, and I truly appreciate you sharing your thoughts!"
