      "content": "Carey, thanks for your post!  As I was reading your post, I was reminded of a new ERP system my company migrated to many years ago.  The migration was difficult, and we painstakingly spent 6-12 months to normalize our operations.  Although we still have our challenges today, the cross-functional data impacts have been powerful.  I can feel your frustration.  It sounds like your company could use some ERP architects to customize your system and some investment/commitment from management in migrating data and utilizing the functionality of your current ERP.  Best wishes on your data journey!"

      "content": "After reading both chapters from Analytics at Work, I have been considering which data maturity stage the company I work for is at.  We do have a large ERP system that brings functional data together, we do have data warehouses, we have functional analysts, and we do use analytics.  However, we still have data quality issues, our data consists only of internal data, I’m not sure we’re using our data for competitive purposes, and we’re still utilizing analytics in a siloed functional capacity.  I believe my company may be entering stage 4 as an analytical company.   Which analytic/data stages are the organizations you work for in?"
