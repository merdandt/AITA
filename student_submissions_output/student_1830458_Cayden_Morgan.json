      "content": "Hello Jared, I agree, data quality is just as important as the amount of data collected. The Montana State Fund example was a great way to show how organizations can protect the accuracy with their data. Using a watermark to confirm that reports came from a verified source is a smart way to prevent tampering.\nIt reminds me of how some companies use data tracking tools to show where the data came from and how it’s been used. These checks help people trust the data and make better decisions. Even for smaller organizations, simple steps like regular audits or version control can make a big difference in keeping the data clean!"

      "content": "One idea from the readings that stood out to me was the five-stage model of analytical progress, especially the final stage, Analytical Competitors. At this level, a company doesn’t just use data occasionally. It relies on it as a core part of how it operates and makes decisions. Reaching this point isn’t just about having the right systems in place, it also takes a mindset across the whole organization that values learning from evidence and using it to guide action.\n \nWith that being said, here’s my question: What does it really take for a company to become an Analytical Competitor, and how can it hold onto that advantage in a world where things change so quickly? Is it more about the tools, the people, the leadership, or something else entirely?"
