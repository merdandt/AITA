      "content": "The principles of Eratosthenes experiment ring true, in fact by metrics of his time it incredible that he could come to such remarkable find. However I propose the question that in today’s world, is it difficult to further measure intangibles because there is insatiable need for perfect information. When any factor of doubt is proposed it is the common trend to throw the baby out with the bathwater. To prove this point, I found a Harvard study titled “The Significance and Errors of Eratosthenes Method For The Measurement Of The Size And Shape Of The Earths Surface” in this, the author suggests that while a significant experiment for its time, the errors of calculation (such as inaccurate measuring tools, seasons, etc) create moot point for the experiment, implying that today it would not be valid. I think this is less because of the experiment and more because of the people (another great example of an intangible measurement) who would see an inaccurate measurement tool and say the whole entire experiment is useless. So as we continually see this trend increase in a linear fashion, a more interesting questions is would Eratosthenes’ experiment have been accepted the same in late 1800’s as it would have been in the 1900’s? How has modern science made it harder to accept basic scientific finds?\nhttps://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2006JAHH....9...57P"

      "content": "I thought you posed a good question, I work for General Motors as an engineer, and in my plant I work at many of our machines have fantastic data outputs available, because of this many people assume we are very data driven, because we have access to this information, yet the reality is we don't even export it to spreadsheet to analyze. Its like how Davenport said in chapter 2, data consists of structured content. Access and observation of data alone is not truly data analytics, rather the usage and structure of them are. I thought it was interesting that the criteria you gave brought up another intangible measurement, meaningful. Clean and easy to find could be measured, but is it meaningful? This is more difficult to measure. This is where the 5 steps given Hubbard come into play, where after you assess what you know you have to go back and find how to measure those. (step 2 in Hubbards 5 steps)"
