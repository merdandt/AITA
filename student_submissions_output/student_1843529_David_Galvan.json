      "content": "Hi Brent, I got my associates in Digital Marketing, so your response is really interesting to me. I also come from an Economics background and I am currently in a Supply Chain Management role. I think when I was studying marketing strategies it seemed like the perfect way to understand customer behavior, targeting ads based on social engagement. As a consumer, I don't mind being targeted based on engagement, since usually they are products that are of interest to me based on previous engagement. Obviously, users want to know what data is being collected and why, so they prefer to opt-in rather than be automatically tracked. So, obviously data should be protected so its not misused, but also I think it's better for the company and users that only necessary data should be collected, nothing excessive, irrelevant, or too personal, which might provide better data quality. I think this is where I would draw the line. As a non marketing person I think purpose driven data collection is key in supply chain management as well in order to collect only what’s necessary to maintain readiness and efficiency, but also incorporating data governance and access control to protect sensitive information, especially when dealing with international partners. So, just like in marketing, there's a growing need in defense logistics to balance quality and useful data, as well as privacy, especially as systems become more automated with AI, and just like users want to opt-in, partners also want to know and trust that data is being used for the right purpose and ethically."

      "content": "I thought it was really interesting and useful to learn how important good data is in analytics, along with the fundamentals of good data: structure, uniqueness, integration, quality, access, privacy, and governance. In my job, I work with data all the time, especially each month when I review what my teammates have been working on and track our program’s progress to share with the team and our supervisors. Lately, we’ve been having issues with some data inconsistencies, so this topic really hits close to home. Data analytics is essential for my day-to-day tasks, and if the data isn’t solid and doesn’t check all those boxes, it just looks like a bunch of numbers on a spreadsheet that don’t mean much. The two things that stood out to me the most, especially since I’ve been trying to improve how we capture data, are making sure the data is high-quality and well-structured. That’s key when it comes to planning and running global operations. For example, if we have bad or outdated inventory data for aircraft parts, it can slow down maintenance, ground aircraft, and disrupt missions. And when different bases or countries use inconsistent data formats, it can delay coordination and slow everything down. But when the data is clean and consistent, it helps us make better decisions, improve logistics, and keep everything running smoothly."
