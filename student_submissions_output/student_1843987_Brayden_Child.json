      "content": "My answer to your question would be research. I did an internship in a cancer research lab. As I was working and reading research papers published by other labs, it was crazy to see the results that researchers would draw from their results. We would look at those same numbers and wonder how they got from the data to their conclusion. Sometimes it's just a researcher trying to prove his or her  hypothesis correct. Other times it can be because of funding. Researchers are paid based on grants that they receive from companies or the government or some other organization. And sometimes that funding comes with an expectation (like proving that their product really works). If the data shows that the product only works 25% of the time, researchers can still be inclined to claim that it works so they can continue getting paid."

      "content": "I found the section on the 5 stages of organizational progress in analytics interesting. It occurred to me that I have seen a couple of those stages at work. The clinic I work at was recently bought by another, larger clinic. Seeing how they run business, I have seen more analytics involved than how the clinic was run before. They spend a lot of time and money looking at reports to make business decisions, where before the owner made decisions based on his opinion of how to run the business.\nI found this link talking about the necessity of using analytics specifically in the veterinary field. \nhttps://veterinaryha.org/leveraging-data-analytics-for-business-growth-in-veterinary-practices/#:~:text=Data%20analytics%20is%20a%20game,satisfaction%2C%20and%20ultimately%20boost%20profitability\n    \n\nLinks to an external site..\nI have never thought that analytics would be so applicable in any sort of healthcare field. For the most part, I've always thought that people went to the doctor when they needed it and advertising or changing things about your practice would have little effect. Now, based on my own experience and on the material from this week, I see that analytics can have an impact in any sort of field."
