      "content": "I thought this was interesting to think about as well and have felt similar issues when forced to do employee reviews. Unfortunately my company never really does any sort of surveys like you all describe. I think they sent out one to everyone nearly 10 years ago last that I recall. Maybe part of the reluctance is that they are concerned they might get bad information from bad questions, but I think mostly everyone is just too busy in meetings and doing whatever that nothing like this happens. I would appreciate a quarterly survey like you describe, but at this point I would take once a year. This makes me realize even more though how difficult and how much thought should be put into the questions before doing anything like that to try to get the best quality data."

      "content": "There were several points and specific words that stood out to me that felt like these chapters were specifically written to address my company. One quote, \"First, even touchy-feely-sounding things like “employee empowerment,” “creativity,” or “strategic alignment” must have observable consequences if they matter at all.\" reminds me of similar mottos and phrases that my company tries to use to guide our goals, but I've never really seen or heard of any way that anyone has attempted to measure how we might be doing on those goals. \n\"For many decision makers, it is simply a habit to default to labeling something as intangible when the measurement method isn’t immediately apparent. This habit can sometimes be seen in the “steering committees” of many organizations. These committees may review proposed investments and decide which to accept or reject.\"\nWe literally have an IT steering committee that meets regularly to discuss ideas and big changes for the company, but no one ever hears or sees anything until these very few and select \"experts\" make some giant decision that massively impacts everyone in the company. Besides some direct costs, I haven't seen anything from the committee notes ever that indicates any other measuring of impacts on the company. In a good and bad way, it looks like this course will teach me many of the things the management in my company is doing wrong."
