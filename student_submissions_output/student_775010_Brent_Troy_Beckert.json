      "content": "Coming from the digital marketing industry, there were so many key points that stood out to me in these chapters; things I've experienced, things I want to apply, and so on.  I've whittled down my whiteboard of thoughts and questions into the following two. \n1. Digital marketing is split between two major groups called Branding and Performance Generation. Branding often falls into the trap that the efforts are immeasurable, and therefore turns to more subjective modes for decision making (huge opportunity to measure the immeasurable and improve decision making and performance). Performance Generation is usually very data-focused, but in recent years, the quality of the data has decreased with privacy policies (like iOS 14.5). From my perspective, I don't think users should have privacy based on the social engagement (watching content, clicking links, visiting websites), but the number of people that opt in to sharing privacy data with iOS is staggeringly low (I also don't opt in to share my data). What's the difference between physical engagement (walking into a store and having a rep try to sell to you) and digital engagement (visiting a website and being hit with retargeting ads)? This is one small part of social media privacy policies, but I'm curious, what do people not in marketing think the line should be for data collection of users?\n2. My second key point that I wanted to highlight in this comment is about the role employees can play to progress or advance the stage in the model of progress. At my current role and company, we are the definition of stage 2 (localized) for data. When I started a few months ago, I pushed for the marketing team to create its own data stores since we didn't have anything available company-wide. Since then, I've found that both HR and finance are using their own approaches to data. When addressing the need to senior leadership to create a company wide data structure I'm met with resistance on a few fronts: it would be too expensive, each groups needs their own data so it is relevant to them, management doesn't want to deal with it - if divisions do that is there responsibility/problem. How can I help advance the stage/desire for company-wide data and the expectation to use data in decision-making in a company that initially doesn't care for it?"

      "content": "David, I appreciate your post and agree with it - it is critical to make sure the data is high-quality and well-structured.  You're in an interesting position where you have data, but the issues you're trying to solve revolve around improving the quality. in the text, they mentioned something that stood out to me: focus on the data collection. This fits into lean methodologies, which I love and embrace! You don't want to move along a product (of data in this case) with errors, as it will compound the problem. Addressing the data collection first will allow the adjustments made at the other points of the data analysis process to be more impactful. Good luck with the project of improving the data!"
